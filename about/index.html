            <h1><strong>HELLO!</strong></h1>
            <p>I'm Anni and I'm currently a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm originally from China but I've been living in New York City since 2006. I am majoring in computer science and planning to minor in Design or Human Computer Interaction. I have always loved art and technology and I enjoy exploring fields that are a combination of both. In the near future I want to create objects and tools that are both aesthetically pleasing and useful. I have a dog named Bubbles who lives in Inner Mongolia with my grandparents. I also love photography, sports, and good books! Find me on instagram @<a href ="http://instagram.com/bananaherbs">bananaherbs</a></p>
