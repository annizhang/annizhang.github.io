            <h1><strong>HELLO!</strong></h1>
            <p>I'm Anni and I'm currently a junior at Carnegie Mellon University. I was born in China but I've been living in New York City since 2006. I am majoring in computer science and pursuing double minors in Human Computer Interaction and German. I have always loved art and technology and I enjoy exploring fields that are a combination of both. In the near future I want to create technology that are both aesthetically pleasing and useful. I have a cat named Bing Bing Baby. I also love photography, sports, and good books! Find me on instagram @<a href ="http://instagram.com/bananaherbs">bananaherbs</a></p>
