            <h1><strong>HELLO!</strong></h1>
            <p>I'm Anni and I'm currently a student at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm originally from China but I've been living in New York City since 2006. I am majoring in computer science and planning to minor in Human Computer Interaction. I have always loved art and technology and I enjoy exploring fields that are combine both. Some other stuff about me: I like to run, play soccer, take photos and read. 
In the near future I want to create objects and tools that are both aesthetically pleasing and useful. I have a dog named Bubbles who lives in Inner Mongolia with my grandparents. Find me on instagram @ <a href ="http://instagram.com/bananaherbs>bananaherbs">bananaherbs</a></p>
